# Discord-Bot-3-Oficial
This is a Discord Bot made by me in order to improve my python coding skills, as well as gaining experience with Yaml and APIs.

This bot was developed to work together with the following bots:
## Estado Soviético:
  [github.com/LuanPoi/Discord-Bot-1-Estado](https://github.com/LuanPoi/Discord-Bot-1-Estado)

## Guarda Soviético:
  [github.com/LuanPoi/Discord-Bot-2-Guarda](https://github.com/LuanPoi/Discord-Bot-2-Guarda)

### Recommendations:
I recommed execute the following command on your git local repository to avoid publish your Discord API Key.
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged config.yaml
```
